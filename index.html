            This is my first site. I have been working towards my degree and
            learning skills to create websites for our game company. The first
            time I learned about coding was when I had a MySpace. I found it
            interesting. I had no idea it was actually cool and I would one day
            make websites!

            I hope you had a great holiday season! My dad came to our home for
            close to 3 weeks! We did a lot of fun things! We went to a chiefs
            game, went to an aquarium, went to a casino where he won $250 off of
            4 dueces, and hung out with the kids!
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all I have had a wonderful holiday season!! I really hope you
            have as well! May you have a wonderful year filled with joy, good
            health, peace, and good fortune!!! Happy New Year!!!
